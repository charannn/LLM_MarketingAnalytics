**Data Preparation**

**Loading and Cleaning:**

Use libraries like pandas to load the CSV data.
Handle missing values (if any). Look for NaN values in the dataframe. 
You might impute them (e.g., fill with the mean or median of the column) or remove rows with missing data.

**Feature Engineering (Important for LLMs with Tabular Data)**  :

LLMs work best with text. You need to transform your numerical and categorical features into textual descriptions. This is the most important step for this kind of task.

**Create Textual Features:** Instead of feeding the numbers directly, create sentences describing the customer. 

```python
import pandas as pd

def create_textual_description(row):
    description = f"This customer has an income of {row['Income']:.0f}."
    if row['Kidhome'] > 0:
        description += f" They have {int(row['Kidhome'])} children at home."
    if row['Teenhome'] > 0:
        description += f" They have {int(row['Teenhome'])} teenagers at home."

    # Check if the columns exist before accessing them
    if 'marital_status' in row.index:
        marital_status = ''
        for col in row.index:
            if col.startswith('marital_') and row[col] == 1:
                marital_status = col[8:]  # Extract status after "marital_"
                break
        description += f" They are {marital_status}."
    else:
        description += " Marital status information is missing." # Handle the case where the column is missing


    if 'education' in row.index:
        education_level = ''
        for col in row.index:
            if col.startswith('education_') and row[col] == 1:
                education_level = col[10:]  # Extract level after "education_"
                break
        description += f" They have a {education_level} education."
    else:
        description += " Education information is missing." # Handle the case where the column is missing

    description += f" They have made web purchases {int(row['NumWebPurchases'])} times and store purchases {int(row['NumStorePurchases'])} times."

    description += f" Their recency is {int(row['Recency'])} days."

    return description


# Handle NaNs first (important!)
df = df.fillna(df.mean())  # Fill NaNs with column means

# One-hot encode marital status and education only if they exist
# Check if the columns exist before applying pd.get_dummies
if 'marital_status' in df.columns and 'education' in df.columns:
    df = pd.get_dummies(df, columns=['marital_status', 'education'])

df['text_description'] = df.apply(create_textual_description, axis=1)


print(df['text_description'].head().to_list()) #Check to see results

```

**Explanation of the Code:**

create_textual_description(row) function:

Takes a pandas Series (a row from your DataFrame) as input.

Constructs a textual description based on the row's values.

Uses f-strings (formatted string literals) for easy string construction and number formatting (:.0f for no decimal places, int() for integer conversion). This allows you to embed the data directly into the description.

df = pd.read_csv("ifood_df.csv"): Loads your data.

df = df.fillna(df.mean()): Important: Fill any missing NaN values with the mean of the column. LLMs don't like missing data. You could use a different imputation strategy if you prefer.

df = pd.get_dummies(df, columns=['marital_status', 'education']): One-hot encodes the categorical features so they can be parsed properly.

df['text_description'] = df.apply(create_textual_description, axis=1): Applies the create_textual_description function to each row of the DataFrame and creates a new column called text_description containing the generated text.

Target Variable: You'll need a target variable. Let's say you want to predict "campaign responsiveness". You could use the Response column directly or AcceptedCmpOverall.

Split the Data: Split your data into training, validation, and test sets (e.g., 70/15/15 split).
